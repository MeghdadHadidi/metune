### Market Viability (Must Answer First)

| Question | Answer | Confidence | Source |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|

| Is there a dominant player creating winner-takes-all dynamics? | | | |
| Are there emerging technologies creating a window of opportunity? | | | |

### User Economics

| Question | Answer | Confidence | Source |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| How much are users paying (money/time/frustration) to solve this today? | | | |
| What's the expected LTV:CAC ratio? | | | |
