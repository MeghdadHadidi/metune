# User Personas: {Product Name}

## Strategic Questions Checklist

> **Instructions**: Before completing this document, ensure you can answer these fundamental questions. These drive user understanding beyond demographics.

### User Identity

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Who is our PRIMARY user — and who explicitly is NOT? | | |
| What job is the user "hiring" this product to do? | | |
| When they wake up stressed about this problem, what words do they use? | | |

### Current Behavior

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| How do users currently solve this? (Be specific — even if "Excel + email + prayer") | | |
| What workarounds have they invented? (These reveal unmet needs) | | |
| What have they tried that failed? Why did those solutions disappoint? | | |

### Switching Triggers

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| What moment of frustration would push them to search for a new solution? | | |
| What's the emotional "last straw" that motivates change? | | |
| What fears or uncertainties would prevent them from adopting us? | | |

### Success Definition

| Question | Answer | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| How does the user define success in their own words (not our metrics)? | | |
| What would make them tell a colleague about this product? | | |
| After one week of use, what should be measurably different in their life? | | |

### Kill-the-Project Check

> **STOP if any of these are true:**
> - [ ] Can't find real users who are frustrated with current solutions
> - [ ] Users' pain points are vague or hypothetical
> - [ ] No clear "job to be done" articulated
> - [ ] Switching barriers are higher than our differentiation
